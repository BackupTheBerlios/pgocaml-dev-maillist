If you're using Debian, you can try the lipgocaml-ocaml-dev package, 
where these issues are solved.

I think that you need 'open CalendarLib' in your .ml and .mli files. And 
maybe a tweak or two more.

All the best,

By the way, you might eventually want to mention in section 'Building 
instructions' on

	http://pgocaml.berlios.de/

that there is a Debian package for PGOCaml.

Feedback would be appreciated.

All the best,

Done!  I've linked to the package's page at Debian's tracking system.
Is that the canonical homepage for a Debian package?  I've also added
a link to Fedora's equivalent.

Cheers,
