Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] Parse error: currified constructor
Message-ID: <498C1871.7060303@citycable.ch>

Hello,

I managed to compile PG'OCaml on my Debian system. (I will perhaps 
provide a tarball or a package it for Debian when I have some time 
available).

However, I encounter a "Parse error: currified constructor". As I'm not 
really familiar with camlp4, maybe i'm doing something obviously wrong...

Hello.

Here is a PG'OCaml tarball for Debian systems:

http://yziquel.homelinux.org/ocaml/libpgocaml-ocaml-1.1.tar.gz

I have made a few modifications so that "make" and "make 
findlib_install" should be sufficient to have PG'OCaml available on 
Debian systems.

All the best,

Guillaume Yziquel.

Did you solve this one?  As I mentioned yesterday on IRC, it looks
like this happens because the camlp4 extension isn't actually being
loaded, thus the compiler things "PGSQL" is a data type constructor,
not a special keyword.

Yes. I did. I was just not familiar with the way syntax extensions are 
to be loaded. It works fine now.

I just wish to point out that the tarball i made is simply a quick fix: 
It should throw out errors when compiling, and these errors should be 
discarded by the user.

Here's a quick description, in french, of how one can make pgocaml work 
from this tarball:

	http://yziquel.homelinux.org/topos/debian-pgocaml.html

I'll hopefully generate a debian package out of that, but it'll probably 
take some time as i'm not familiar yet with building debian packages.

Thanks - time for a new upstream release I think.
