Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] New patch to trunk
Message-ID: <410484.77022.qm@web111507.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've applied in trunk a patch by Boris Yakobowski that replaces
various occurrences of 'rows' and 'varname' by '_rows' and
'_varname' inside the code generated by the syntax extension.
This silences the 'unused variable' warning that may occur
when you compile code that uses PGOCaml.

Best regards,
Dario Teixeira
