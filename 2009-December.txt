Hi,

While we're all probably tracking SVN trunk and are thus oblivious to
"official" releases, shall we package 1.4 for the benefit of outsiders?

Let me know if someone has a pending patch they would like to include.
Otherwise, I'll tag and release 1.4 as a Christmas present to our users...

Meri Kurisumasu!

P.S. The project lacked a CHANGELOG, so I've added one to trunk.
     I've filled it with information gathered from SVN logs; let
     me know if something is amiss.

I've tagged and released 1.4, and updated the WWW page accordingly.
Note that 1.4 is only available for the "pgocaml" (monadic) variant.

Cheers,
