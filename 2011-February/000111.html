I also use schemas in the same way. I think you can do this and have PGOCaml
work correctly without any hacking in some circumstances: just put

PGSQL(dbh) &quot;execute&quot; &quot;SET search_path TO my_schema&quot;

after your PGOCaml.connect call (or &quot;SET SCHEMA TO my_schema&quot; if using
PostgreSQL 8.4 or later)

&gt;<i> I've been able to modify PGOCaml to take a search_path parameter in the
</I>&gt;<i> connect function, defaulting to the value of the PGSEARCHPATH
</I>&gt;<i> environment variable, and pass this as an additional setting in the
</I>&gt;<i> connect message.  This enables me to set the search path and allow
</I>&gt;<i> PGOCaml to find the tables.
</I>
The problem I got even with that trick above is that my code for connecting
to the server is in one module (i.e. file) and the queries are in another so
using &quot;execute&quot; doesn't work unless you redundantly add it to the top of
each module.

I have a private patch for pa_pgsql.ml4 from a couple of years ago which
I've never submitted as I didn't think it would be widely useful which
generalises what you're proposing slightly differently (I keep it to
pa_pgsql and not the PGOCaml module itself) - it reads the environment
variable PGCOMMAND and executes the SQL statement in it after connecting.
This allows you to put *anything* required before compiling a module (so I
export PGCOMMAND='set search_path to foo' in my Makefile).
