Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] New stuff in trunk

Hi,

I have applied both patches, updated the changelog, and upped
the version number.  Version 1.5 should be released soon (possibly
after we move to the Ocaml Forge).

Yes, I've applied it.  It is indeed better to offer a remedy than
relying on users to remember some obscure caveat in BUGS.txt...

Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] New serialisation format in PostgreSQL 9.0
Message-ID: <408228.65155.qm@web111515.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

No one has complained about this issue yet, so I may have been the first
one to come across it: starting with version 9.0, PostgreSQL introduced
the 'hex' serialisation format for bytea types [1].  PG'OCaml only
supported the old 'escape' format and would incorrectly deserialise
data encoded with the new format.  I have commited to trunk support
for the new format (the old format is of course also supported).

Anyway, don't forget to also upgrade PG'OCaml if you've upgraded PostgreSQL!
(And as always, testing and feedback is welcome!)

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira
