It seems like the Makefile don't compile the .mli files before compiling the

Is this normal ? Does this happen just to me, or it is a more general problem

Hello,

I have another problem, this time with the Calendar package.

I'm using GODI, and I have installed all dependecies of pgocaml using GODI 
(godi-calendar, godi-extlib, godi-csv).

When compiling pgocaml, after the Makefile problem, I have another problem with 
Calendar,

/home/vb/godi311/lib/ocaml/pkg-lib/calendar/calendarLib.a(calendarLib.o):
(.data+0x4a08): first defined here
/home/vb/godi311/lib/ocaml/pkg-lib/calendar/calendarLib.o: In function 
`camlCalendarLib__Printer__hour_388':
(.text+0x10aa0): multiple definition of `camlCalendarLib__Printer__hour_388'

I have many lines of this kind. Did you encounter this problem before ?

Thanks in advance,

Did you issue a "make depend" before compiling?

In any case, version 1.2 is ready for release, and will be out within
the next few hours.  Please give it a try and tell us if you run into
any trouble.

Have you taken into account the patch I proposed in april?
(https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/pgocaml-dev/2009-April/000030.html)
I'd like to check new version, but it's quite critical for me to have  
an ability to work with big data sets.

Myself, not yet.  But not for lack of interest: I just need to find some
time to get myself better acquainted with PG'OCaml's source.  @Richard:
have you looked into this patch already?

In any case, your patch should apply cleanly to the "pgocaml-classic"
branch.  Check out the new homepage for the project for more info:
http://pgocaml.berlios.de/

As per an OSR (Ocaml standards recommendation), the package is now called
pgocaml.syntax.  I'll update the tutorial soon to reflect that and other
changes related to the new PG'OCaml branches.

Hi,

Since there is a general agreement to make the 'monadic' branch the new
main branch of PG'OCaml, you will notice the following changes in SVN:

 - the 'pgocaml-monadic' directory is now called 'pgocaml'
 - the old 'pgocaml' directory is now called 'pgocaml-classic'
 - Version 1.2 of both branches has been tagged and released.

I've also uploaded the new project's page, explaining the reason for the
two branches: http://pgocaml.berlios.de/   (Please update your links)

There are probably still some inconsistencies in the documentation;
please let us know of the most egregious ones...

Cheers,
Dario

Geometric types[1] are useful with embedded functions for distance, ...

Historically, types have been added as needed.  It is actually quite
simple to add new ones: look in pGOCaml.ml for the string_of_whatever
and whatever_of_string functions.  It's really only a matter of
defining good Ocaml analogues.

If you want to provide your patches for this, please give us a diff
against the new 1.2 trunk...

Hi,

A version of the "classic" tree featuring Mykola Stryebkov's patches is in
branches/largesets-classic.  I'll adapt them to the "main" tree and then
I reckon it is time for 1.3.

Also, please provide future patches against the new main tree only
(formerly known as the "monadic" tree).  There's a chance 1.3 will
be the final release of the classic tree.

Hi,

> Here it is (obtained with svn diff, I hope it's OK).

Thanks for the patch.  I have a couple of notes about it though.  One
is easily fixed, but the other is still open:

1) In function string_of_point, you use functions fst and snd to get
   the two components of the tuple.  I changed it to use pattern-matching
   instead, as follows:

   let string_of_point (x, y) =
       "(" ^ (string_of_float x) ^ "," ^ (string_of_float y) ^ ")"

2) In function point_of_string, you define the following regexp for
   the Str module:

   Str.regexp "([ \t]*\\([0-9]*\\)[ \t]*,[ \t]*\\([0-9]*\\)[ \t]*)"

   This regexp will fail for non-integer and/or non-positive floats.
   Moreover, PG'OCaml already links in the PCRE library anyway, so
   you might as well use it instead of linking in yet another lib.

I'm CCing this to the list because I wonder if someone has a better
(lighter) solution than regexps for point_of_string.

Cheers,
Dario

P.S.  Trunk for both 'pgocaml' and 'pgocaml-classic' now includes
      Mykola Stryebkov's patch.  It seems to be working fine: I just
      successfully tested a half-million result set that caused a
      stack overflow in older versions.

Everything is ok for us (with last SVN version). Are you sure your pg_hba.conf 
is ok and also the environment variables (PGPASSWORD etc) ?

Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] Distributing .mli files.
Message-ID: <4A32EA18.8080001@citycable.ch>

Hello.

Here is a patch I used in order to package pgocaml for debian. It simply 
adds .mli files to the files installed by findlib, and thus allows 
automatic ocamldoc documentation generation.

Could it be possible to include this patch upstream?

All the best,

Guillaume Yziquel.

Hello.

Concerning copyright dates, it seems to me that work was done this year 
on PG'OCaml. However, the copyright dates do not reflect this fact.

Could it be possible to amend this?

All the best,

Guillaume Yziquel.

Hi,

Check out current trunk:  I standardised all the headers and copyright
information.  I also expanded the CONTRIBUTORS.txt file to include recent
developments.  Let me know if all is kosher.

Moreover, I patched the Makefile to install the mli files.

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira

Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] Type unraveling
Message-ID: <180987.97964.qm@web111505.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

As you probably know, SQL's "CREATE DOMAIN" command allows the creation
of types which are essentially aliases for existing types.  The advantages
of this are obvious: you can change the underlying type for a column that
appears in various tables simply by changing its alias.

Currently, PG'OCaml cannot handle these types.  If you tried to insert
a row into the table "people" defined below, PG'OCaml would complain that
it knew nothing about the type whose OID corresponds to age_t.

CREATE DOMAIN age_t AS int4;

CREATE TABLE people
        (
        id      int4 UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        name    text NOT NULL,
        age     age_t NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
        );

Under branches/unravel (and branches/unravel-classic) you'll find an
experimental branch that adds support for these types.  It's relatively
simple: it uses the system table pg_type to recursively "unravel" a
domain-type until it finds a base type it is familiar with.  No attempt
is made to cache results, because all of this happens at compile-time
anyway.  Also, I am aware that the upcoming 8.4 release of Postgresql
features recursive queries, which would eliminate the need for putting
the recursion client-side.  It will be a long time, however, before 8.4
is the least common denominator.

Also, under trunk/demos/unravel you'll find a small test example for the
new feature.

Anyway, your comments are welcome.  Yours in particular, Richard, since
you're the most familiar with the code.  (The diff is also attached to
this message).

Cheers,
Dario

I had a quick look and it seems OK.  My main question is why
don't we just do the unravelling by default, instead of having
an option to enable it?  (Possibly I'm missing something).

It is enabled by default, and there's no option to turn it off.
Note that the unraveling is only triggered if there's an exception
in PGOCaml.name_of_type.  I figured it wasn't worth making the
unraveling on/off configurable because I can't think of a situation
where one wouldn't want PG'OCaml to support CREATE DOMAIN.

Cheers,
Dario

Hello.

It would be nice to bump the version to 1.3 in Makefile.config.

All the best,

Well noted.  I bumped up the version number in trunk to 1.4,
in anticipation to the upcoming release.
