Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] PG'OCaml now officially on the OCaml Forge
Message-ID: <1318011602.47954.YahooMailNeo@web111513.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

The migration of PG'OCaml from BerliOS to the OCaml Forge is now complete.
Coincidentally, BerliOS recently announced they would be shutting down within
a few months, so this migration was bound to happen anyway! 


Please update your links and bookmarks to the project's new homepage:
http://pgocaml.forge.ocamlcore.org/

A new mailing-list has been created on the Forge. I have taken the liberty
of inviting to the new list all current subscribers to this (old) list.? You will
need to accept the invitation for your new subscription to take effect.


I've also copied the Subversion repository to its new home.? If you wish
to contribute please apply for project membership on the Forge and I'll
be happy to add you to the developer list.
Best regards,
Dario Teixeira
