Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] Support for more array types
Message-ID: <790988.76275.qm@web111506.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've added support for more array types in PG'OCaml's SVN trunk.
Besides the previously supported int4[], trunk now supports bool[],
int8[], text[], float4[], and float8[].

Under 'demos/arrays' you'll also find a small demo/test programme
for this feature.

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira
