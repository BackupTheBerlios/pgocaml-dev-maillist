Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] Organising PG'OCaml development
Message-ID: <492403.82483.qm@web54607.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi,

In the past few months I had little time to dedicate to PG'OCaml,
but I'm now actively using it again, and would like to revive the
development of the project.  Besides J?r?me Vouillon's suggested
patch, there are other proposed patches and ideas floating around;
therefore, it's time to get ourselves organised.

In the very short term, I suggest you guys make yourselves members
of the Pgocaml-dev list (if you're getting this email twice is because
you already are...).  I will then post a list of issues to be addressed.

Cheers,
Dario

Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] Proposed SVN etiquette
Message-ID: <406620.1408.qm@web54605.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi,

The purpose of this email is to kickstart the discussion on this list.
To begin, I suggest we agree on basic rules concerning modifications to
the SVN repository.  Here are my suggestions:

a) Patches to trunk should be discussed on this list before being commited;

b) Patches to trunk should be independent.  Therefore, "I have a patch that
   does A, B, and C" is not encouraged; it is better to post them independently
   (assuming A, B, and C are independent, of course);

c) The 'branches' tree is open to experiments and/or demonstrating proposed
   patches to trunk;

d) For the time being, the pgocaml-lwt patches by J?r?me Vouillon can reside
   in branches.  However, due to their usefulness to Ocsigen users, I suggest
   we make them available as a tarball alongside trunk's.


Any other points that should be addressed?

Cheers,
Dario
