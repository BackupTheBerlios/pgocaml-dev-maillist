<PRE>Hi,

As you probably know, SQL's &quot;CREATE DOMAIN&quot; command allows the creation
of types which are essentially aliases for existing types.  The advantages
of this are obvious: you can change the underlying type for a column that
appears in various tables simply by changing its alias.

Currently, PG'OCaml cannot handle these types.  If you tried to insert
a row into the table &quot;people&quot; defined below, PG'OCaml would complain that
it knew nothing about the type whose OID corresponds to age_t.

CREATE DOMAIN age_t AS int4;

CREATE TABLE people
        (
        id      int4 UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        name    text NOT NULL,
        age     age_t NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
        );

Under branches/unravel (and branches/unravel-classic) you'll find an
experimental branch that adds support for these types.  It's relatively
simple: it uses the system table pg_type to recursively &quot;unravel&quot; a
domain-type until it finds a base type it is familiar with.  No attempt
is made to cache results, because all of this happens at compile-time
anyway.  Also, I am aware that the upcoming 8.4 release of Postgresql
features recursive queries, which would eliminate the need for putting
the recursion client-side.  It will be a long time, however, before 8.4
is the least common denominator.

Also, under trunk/demos/unravel you'll find a small test example for the
new feature.

Anyway, your comments are welcome.  Yours in particular, Richard, since
you're the most familiar with the code.  (The diff is also attached to
this message).

Cheers,
Dario
