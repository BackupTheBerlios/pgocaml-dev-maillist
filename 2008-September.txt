Hi,

I'm trying to use password authentication with pgocaml. How does it work?
I can't manage to make it work at compile time ... (after that it works).

I read in Dario's manual that we need an environment variable PGPASSWORD
but I can't even find that string in the sources ...

Cheers,
Vincent

You're right, and sorry about that, Vincent.   I've never
used password authentication myself, so that part of the
guide was written about the expected behaviour, not the
one actually observed.

Anyway, I am attaching a small diff that adds support for
the PGPASSORD env variable.  Please let us know if it works
as expected.  However, note that PGOCaml's authentication
support is very basic: it only allows for clear text passwords.
For this reason, relying on PGPASSWORD for security is not a
good idea (which I reckon is the reason that Richard didn't
implement it in the first place).

Cheers,
Dario

The patch looks good.  Vincent, if it works for you then let me know
and I'll apply it.

Rich.

Yes it works well. Thank you to both of you.
Actually I'm using the lwt branch. I suppose Jaap is maintaining it?
Jaap, could you apply the patch in that version too?

Vincent

Yes, looks like in fact we don't get the password from any environment
variable.

I don't use password authentication with postgres - either ident or
trust (host-based).

You can set it per-statement using:

  PGSQL(dbh) "password=foo" "select ..."

although that might not scale very well for you ...  Alternatively
you'll need to patch pGOCaml.ml.

Rich.
