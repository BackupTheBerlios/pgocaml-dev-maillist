Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] Record label "contents" not allowed with PGOCaml?
Message-ID: <6E696C7D-06EB-43F2-8148-0560CBD13FAB@dbp.mm.st>

I just ran across a funny thing - I had a type like

type t = {id : int32; ... contents : string; ... }

And then any PGOCaml string, like:
PGSQL(dbh) "SELECT id, contents, ..."

Would throw a type error:
Error: This expression has type int ref
       but an expression was expected of type t

Wit the character specification being the string of the query (ie, starting at SELECT in the above example).

By renaming the field to something else (which now doesnt line up with what is in the database...), the code works fine.

Is this expected behavior, and if so, is it documented? I looked back through Dario Teixeira's brief introduction and couldn't find any reference to this problem or indeed to any reserved words in general. Or is it a more subtle thing going that I'm just not understanding?
