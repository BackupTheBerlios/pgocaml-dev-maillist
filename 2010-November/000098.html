<PRE>Hi,

Under branches/hstore you will find a new branch (forked from the latest
trunk) that adds support for hstore types.  As you may know, the hstore
type is essentially a dictionary that maps text keys into text values
(possibly NULL).

Hstore is still part of Postgresql's contrib modules, and though it was
also provided in previous versions, in 9.0 it has seen many improvements.

On the Ocaml side, I've chosen to represent a hstore as an association
list of key/value pairs, with the key being a string, and the value a
string option.  In other words:

type hstore = (string * string option) list

While it would be trivial to use a Hashtbl or Map instead, I reckon that
if you are relying on hstores to store huge dictionaries you may be altogether
better off rethinking your choice of Postgresql as a backend...

The patch is fairly straightforward, with the exception that it does
require adding a wrapper around name_of_type to query the database
concerning the type name when the OID is unknown (Hstores do not have
a fixed OID).  In fact, I think that in a future refactoring/cleanup
of PG'OCaml, it would make sense to rely more on this mechanism than
on 'magic' OIDs.

Anyway, let me know what you think.  If others find this useful I can
merge the branch back into trunk...

Best regards,
Dario Teixeira

P.S. Under demos/hstore you will find a simple example that illustrates
     the use of hstores.
