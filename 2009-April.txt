Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] "More than 5M" problem
Message-ID: <BA5FA530-2782-498E-B537-5D515E924480@mykola.org>

Hi,

I've encountered a problem with more than 5M rows data sets. For my  
data sets there are not enough stack to map list of raw string results  
to list of typed tuples.

Exact problem is in using List.map that is not tail-end recursive and,  
therefore, uses too much stack for  huge datasets. To resolve this  
issue i propose the attached  patch.

Patch do the following:

1. Exclude function do_execute from PGOCaml.execute
2. Extend its parameters with boolean flag indicating if resulting raw  
rows list should be reversed.
3. Modify PGOCaml.execute accordingly
4. Introduce new functions PGOCaml.execute_rev that does not reverse  
rows list.
5. Use this function together with List.rev_map in pa_pgsql.ml4 to  
avoid stack overflow.

It works for me and I'd be glad to hear any replies.

Hi,

I made some rearrangements to SVN.  Most significantly, the 'lwt' branch
has been moved into trunk, and is now called 'pgocaml-lwt'.  We should try
to keep it synchronised with the "main" project proper, which now sits in
directory trunk/pgocaml.

You will also note a new trunk tree called 'pgoctut'.  I've uploaded there
the LaTeX sources for my tutorial.

There are also two (for now) empty directories: 'www' and 'godi'.  The
former will contain the source files for the project's new homepage (which
I'll work on soon).  The latter is for whatever is needed for a GODI port
(I have no experience creating GODI packages myself, but I reckon it should
not be too difficult).

Cheers,
Dario

Hi,

Why not keeping only the lwt branch? As the it is compatible with the other 
one, it would really be easier to maintain, isn't it? ... May be you've 
already discussed that before?
Debian will probably include the lwt branch. 

Cheers,
Vincent [who is not a developer of pgocaml-lwt]

In the long term, you're probably right.  For me the reason why it's
sensible to keep both branches for now is because some people may be
using conventional PGOCaml in production and they may feel queasy
about switching, even if the patches are not that intrusive and the
API is compatible.

> Debian will probably include the lwt branch.

Btw, who will be maintaining the Debian package?  I would really like
to make PGOCaml's build system a bit more distro-friendly, so we can
have at least packages for "the big three" (Fedora, Debian, GODI).

Cheers,
Dario

St?phane Glondu will probably do it when some other package needs it(?)
(May be for Ocsimore).

Hi,

Two things:

a) I think PGOCaml's build system can be cleanup quite a bit by assuming
   that findlib is always installed.  I know this is true for Debian and
   GODI, and I am guessing right in assuming that's also true for recent
   Fedoras?  If so, I vote for the findlibisation of the Makefile.

b) I think you are aware of the CalendarLib pack changes for Calendar > 2.0.
   Therefore, I vote for making PGOCaml depend on Calendar > 2.0, and not
   worry about older version compatibility.

Cheers,
Dario

Just to clarify: the bits of the Makefile that need to be findlib-aware
are those relating to Camlp4.  For example the invocation "$(shell ocamlfind
query pcre)/pcre.cma" hardwires the name of the lib to be pcre.cma instead
of discovering it via findlib.

Cheers,
Dario

Yes and yes.
