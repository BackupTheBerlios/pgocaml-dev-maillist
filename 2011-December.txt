Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] New maintainer needed for the Batteries package
Message-ID: <4EF29CA5.7010500@elehack.net>

I no longer have time to maintain the Batteries package for PGOCaml. If
someone would like to take over the packages, just let me know & start
committing :) (and ping Gerd Stolpmann if you don't have a GODI account
yet).

Thanks,
- Michael
