Subject: [Pgocaml-dev] Updates: web page and lwt branch
Message-ID: <197518.5354.qm@web111516.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>


Hi,

This message is just an update on the webpage front and the mainstreaming
of the Lwt branch.  (@St?phane: I'm CCing you because Vincent Balat said
you might be creating the Debian package for the project).  The points:

 - The new webpage draft is at trunk/www.  I mostly adapted the content
   from the existing webpage, but added some new stuff as well.  Note that
   there's also a tentative logo for the project.  Its meaning should be
   clear, but do tell me if you find a bit too cutesy.

 - The new webpage makes no mention of older (pre 3.10) versions.  Is there
   someone still using those?

 - I cleanup the build system for the two branches.  Also, Makefile.config
   now tries to auto-determine the location for Postgresql's command socket.
   (If someone knows a distro-agnostic way of doing this, please let me know).

 - The Lwt branch is now called 'pgocaml-monadic'.  Though Lwt is of course
   the monad that everyone is thinking about, I reckon it is fairer to J?r?me
   Vouillon's patches to call it 'monadic', since it's not tied to Lwt.

 - It's now possible to install both branches side by side.  The findlib
   packages are named 'pgocaml' and 'pgocaml-monadic', respectively.
   @St?phane/@Richard: would it be possible to have the Debian/Fedora
   packages follow the same convention?  Some users may wish to have
   both branches installed.

 - The 'statements' sub-package is now called 'syntax', in accordance to
   the OSR.

If everything is okay, we can release version 1.2 and put the trunk/www
webpage online.

Cheers,
Dario

Not me, but in any case people who care about the older version of
OCaml can still use (and maintain) the old PG'OCaml.  I wouldn't worry
about it for the main project.

It would be nice to use autotools and ocaml-autoconf at some point.

Yes, this is possible.  Of course for Fedora it'd have to be called
ocaml-pgocaml-monadic, and libpgocaml-monadic-ocaml-dev for Debian (I
think).

Thanks for looking after this.

Rich.

Is there any interest to have just pgocaml? Isn't pgocaml-monadic a
superset of pgocaml? If so, I guess I will just package pgocaml-monadic.

Myself, I've also switched and I'm now only using pgocaml-monadic.
However, for API compatibility purposes with some code out there,
it is reasonable to keep maintaining both branches for now.

As for the Debian package, I agree it does make some sense to package
only pgocaml-monadic, since it reduces confusion and you don't have the
backwards compatibility problem.

Cheers,
Dario

I've got quite a large body of code which depends on the current API.

Any chance of a quick summary of the changes I will have to make to
use the new API?

Okay.  I'll add the download link to the old tar.gz on the webpage.

> It would be nice to use autotools and ocaml-autoconf at some point.

Indeed.  I added a hackish auto-detection for DEFAULT_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKET_DIR,
and that works fine on my Debian system (and I guess works also on Fedora).
However, I expect any time now we'll get complaints from users of other
distros or BSD/MacOSX/Windows.

Anyway, apart from the above, is everyone happy with the new trunk and
the web page?  If so, I'll put it online.

Cheers,
Dario

If you use the 'pgocaml' branch, then none, of course.  But I assume
you are asking about 'pgocaml-monadic'.  In that case, the API is
essentially the same, except that all functions of the PG'OCaml API
are part of a monad.  Attached is an example using the Lwt monad.  Note
that the actual monad used is specified via a functor; if you don't
want to use Lwt you can pass the identity monad to the functor.

As you can see from the example, you don't have to learn a new API,
but you do have to program in a monadic fashion, which may or not
be to your liking  (myself I learned about monads with Lwt; after
some initial bangs on a wall I eventually got used to it).

Cheers,
Dario

Please do, whenever you think it's ready.

OK, I think it's better to keep both branches, for me at least.

Actually that's only if you want to make your code cooperative.
Otherwise, you don't need to change anything if pgocaml-monadic is installed 
on your system instead of pgocaml, as pgocaml.mli is exactly the same as 
before (actually there are just two extra functions: bind and return).

$ cat pGOCaml.mli

include PGOCaml_generic.PGOCAML_GENERIC
  with type 'a monad = 'a

Neat trick!

Sorry, but I hadn't realised this before.  This means indeed that
going forward it makes sense to make the monadic branch the sole branch.

I'll update the web page with this info...

Cheers,
Dario

Hi,

Please check the updated version of the webpage at trunk/www.
The section about the branches depicts my (revised) opinion on how
to proceed.  Note that I still think that at least for this coming
release the two branches should be available.  Even if the API
compatibility issue turned out to be moot (thank you Vincent for
clearing that out!), there's still the issue of existing patches
to the old code base.

Also, to make the transition easier, I suggest the branches get renamed:

pgocaml          -> pgocaml-old
pgocaml-monadic  -> pgocaml

This way forward-compatibility is ensured, and there's no confusion
concerning the naming of the Debian package, for example.

Cheers,
Dario
