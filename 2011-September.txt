Hi,

I received a patch from Mat?as Giovanniniadding support for cursors.
I haven't had much time to play with it yet, but I did create a branch
(under branches/cursor) where this patch is applied, so everyone can
check out this new feature in the meantime.


In unrelated news, I've registered the PG'OCaml project in the OCaml Forge.
I realise moving is a minor inconvenience, but I reckon it to be outweighed
by the advantages:

? - Better visibility within the OCaml community.
? - Larger pool of OCaml developers who already have a Forge account.
Moreover, it's possible to import the entire SVN repository, so there
will be no loss of commit history.

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira
